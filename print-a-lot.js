const lotsOText = `There was once a boy named Milo who didn't know what to do with himself—
not just sometimes, but always.
When he was in school he longed to be out, and when he was out he longed to
be in. On the way he thought about coming home, and coming home he thought
about going. Wherever he was he wished he were somewhere else, and when he got
there he wondered why he'd bothered. Nothing really interested him—least of all
the things that should have.
"It seems to me that almost everything is a waste of time," he remarked one day
as he walked dejectedly home from school. "I can't see the point in learning to solve
useless problems, or subtracting turnips from turnips, or knowing where Ethiopia is
or how to spell February." And, since no one bothered to explain otherwise, he
regarded the process of seeking knowledge as the greatest waste of time of all.
As he and his unhappy thoughts hurried along (for while he was never anxious
to be where he was going, he liked to get there as quickly as possible) it seemed a
great wonder that the world, which was so large, could sometimes feel so small and
empty.
"And worst of all," he continued sadly, "there's nothing for me to do, nowhere
I'd care to go, and hardly anything worth seeing." He punctuated this last thought
with such a deep sigh that a house sparrow singing nearby stopped and rushed home
to be with his family.
Without stopping or looking up, he rushed past the buildings and busy shops
that lined the street and in a few minutes reached home—dashed through the
lobby—hopped onto the elevator—two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and off
again—opened the apartment door—rushed into his room—flopped dejectedly into
a chair, and grumbled softly, "Another long afternoon."
He looked glumly at all the things he owned. The books that were too much
trouble to read, the tools he'd never learned to use, the small electric automobile he
hadn't driven in months—or was it years?—and the hundreds of other games and
toys, and bats and balls, and bits and pieces scattered around him. And then, to one
side of the room, just next to the phonograph, he noticed something he had certainly
never seen before.
Who could possibly have left such an enormous package and such a strange
one? For, while it was not quite square, it was definitely not round, and for its size it
was larger than almost any other big package of smaller dimension that he'd ever
seen.
Attached to one side was a bright-blue envelope which said simply: "FOR
MILO, WHO HAS PLENTY OF TIME."
Of course, if you've ever gotten a surprise package, you can imagine how
puzzled and excited Milo was; and if you've never gotten one, pay close attention,
because someday you might.
"I don't think it's my birthday," he puzzled, "and Christmas must be months
away, and I haven't been outstandingly good, or even good at all." (He had to admit
this even to himself.) "Most probably I won't like it anyway, but since I don't know
where it came from, I can't possibly send it back." He thought about it for quite a
while and then opened the envelope, but just to be polite.
"ONE GENUINE TURNPIKE TOLLBOOTH," it stated—and then it went on:
"EASILY ASSEMBLED AT HOME, AND FOR USE BY THOSE WHO
HAVE NEVER TRAVELED IN LANDS BEYOND."
"Beyond what?" thought Milo as he continued to read.
"THIS PACKAGE CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING ITEMS:
"One (1) genuine turnpike tollbooth to be erected according to directions.
"Three (3) precautionary signs to be used in a precautionary fashion.
"Assorted coins for use in paying tolls.
"One (1) map, up to date and carefully drawn by master cartographers,
depicting natural and man-made features.
"One (1) book of rules and traffic regulations, which may not be bent or
broken."
And in smaller letters at the bottom it concluded: "Results are not guaranteed,
but if not perfectly satisfied, your wasted time will be refunded."
Following the instructions, which told him to cut here, lift there, and fold back
all around, he soon had the tollbooth unpacked and set up on its stand. He fitted the
windows in place and attached the roof, which extended out on both sides and
fastened on the coin box. It was very much like the tollbooths he'd seen many times
on family trips, except of course it was much smaller and purple.
"What a strange present," he thought to himself. "The least they could have
done was to send a highway with it, for it's terribly impractical without one." But
since, at the time, there was nothing else he wanted to play with, he set up the three
signs,
SLOW DOWN APPROACHING TOLLBOOTH
PLEASE HAVE YOUR FARE READY
HAVE YOUR DESTINATION IN MIND
and slowly unfolded the map.
As the announcement stated, it was a beautiful map, in many colors, showing
principal roads, rivers and seas, towns and cities, mountains and valleys,
intersections and detours, and sites of outstanding interest both beautiful and
historic.
The only trouble was that Milo had never heard of any of the places it
indicated, and even the names sounded most peculiar.
"I don't think there really is such a country," he concluded after studying it
carefully. "Well, it doesn't matter anyway." And he closed his eyes and poked a
finger at the map.
"Dictionopolis," read Milo slowly when he saw what his finger had chosen.
"Oh, well, I might as well go there as anywhere."
He walked across the room and dusted the car off carefully. Then, taking the
map and rule book with him, he hopped in and, for lack of anything better to do,
drove slowly up to the tollbooth. As he deposited his coin and rolled past he
remarked wistfully, "I do hope this is an interesting game, otherwise the afternoon
will be so terribly dull."
Suddenly he found himself speeding along an unfamiliar country highway, and
as he looked back over his shoulder neither the tollbooth nor his room nor even the
house was anywhere in sight. What had started as make-believe was now very real.
"What a strange thing to have happen," he thought (just as you must be
thinking right now). "This game is much more serious than I thought, for here I am
riding on a road I've never seen, going to a place I've never heard of, and all because
of a tollbooth which came from nowhere. I'm certainly glad that it's a nice day for a
trip," he concluded hopefully, for, at the moment, this was the one thing he
definitely knew.
The sun sparkled, the sky was clear, and all the colors he saw seemed to be
richer and brighter than he could ever remember. The flowers shone as if they'd
been cleaned and polished, and the tall trees that lined the road shimmered in
silvery green.
"WELCOME TO EXPECTATIONS," said a carefully lettered sign on a small
house at the side of the road.
"INFORMATION, PREDICTIONS, AND ADVICE CHEERFULLY
OFFERED. PARK HERE AND BLOW HORN."
With the first sound from the horn a little man in a long coat came rushing from
the house, speaking as fast as he could and repeating everything several times:
"My, my, my, my, my, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome to the land of
Expectations, to the land of Expectations, to the land of Expectations. We don't get
many travelers these days; we certainly don't get many travelers these days. Now
what can I do for you? I'm the Whether Man.
"Is this the right road for Dictionopolis?" asked Milo, a little bowled over by
the effusive greeting.
"Well now, well now, well now," he began again, "I don't know of any wrong
road to Dictionopolis, so if this road goes to Dictionopolis at all it must be the right
road, and if it doesn't it must be the right road to somewhere else, because there are
no wrong roads to anywhere. Do you think it will rain?"
"I thought you were the Weather Man," said Milo, very confused.
"Oh no," said the little man, "I'm the Whether Man, not the Weather Man, for
after all it's more important to know whether there will be weather than what the
weather will be." And with that he released a dozen balloons that sailed off into the
sky. "Must see which way the wind is blowing," he said, chuckling over his little
joke and watching them disappear in all directions.
"What kind of a place is Expectations?" inquired Milo, unable to see the humor
and feeling very doubtful of the little man's sanity.
"Good question, good question," he exclaimed. "Expectations is the place you
must always go to before you get to where you're going. Of course, some people
never go beyond Expectations, but my job is to hurry them along whether they like
it or not. Now what else can I do for you?" And before Milo could reply he rushed
into the house and reappeared a moment later with a new coat and an umbrella.
"I think I can find my own way," said Milo, not at all sure that he could. But,
since he didn't understand the little man at all, he decided that he might as well
move on—at least until he met someone whose sentences didn't always sound as if
they would make as much sense backwards as forwards.
"Splendid, splendid, splendid," exclaimed the Whether Man. "Whether or not
you find your own way, you're bound to find some way. If you happen to find my
way, please return it, as it was lost years ago. I imagine by now it's quite rusty. You
did say it was going to rain, didn't you?" And with that he opened the umbrella and
walked with Milo to the car.
"I'm glad you made your own decision. I do so hate to make up my mind about
anything, whether its good or bad, up or down, in or out, rain or shine. Expect
everything, I always say, and the unexpected never happens. Now please drive
carefully; good-by, good-by, good-by, good..." His last good-by was drowned out
by an enormous clap of thunder, and as Milo drove down the road in the bright
sunshine he could see the Whether Man standing in the middle of a fierce
cloudburst that seemed to be raining only on him.
The road dipped now into a broad green valley and stretched toward the
horizon. The little car bounced along with very little effort, and Milo had hardly to
touch the accelerator to go as fast as he wanted. He was glad to be on his way again.
"It's all very well to spend time in Expectations," he thought, "but talking to
that strange man all day would certainly get me nowhere. He's the most peculiar
person I've ever met," continued Milo—unaware of how many peculiar people he
would shortly encounter.
As he drove along the peaceful highway he soon fell to daydreaming and paid
less and less attention to where he was going. In a short time he wasn't paying any
attention at all, and that is why, at a fork in the road, when a sign pointed to the left,
Milo went to the right, along a route which looked suspiciously like the wrong way.
Things began to change as soon as he left the main highway. The sky became
quite gray and, along with it, the whole countryside seemed to lose its color and
assume the same monotonous tone. Everything was quiet, and even the air hung
heavily. The birds sang only gray songs and the road wound back and forth in an
endless series of climbing curves.
Mile after
mile after
mile after
mile he drove, and now, gradually the car went slower and slower, until it was
hardly moving at all.
"It looks as though I'm getting nowhere," yawned Milo, becoming very drowsy
and dull. "I hope I haven't taken a wrong turn."
Mile after
mile after
mile after
mile, and everything became grayer and more monotonous. Finally the car just
stopped altogether, and, hard as he tried, it wouldn't budge another inch.
"I wonder where I am," said Milo in a very worried tone.
"You're... in... the... Dol... drums," wailed a voice that sounded far away.
He looked around quickly to see who had spoken. No one was there, and it was
as quiet and still as one could imagine.
"Yes... the... Dol... drums," yawned another voice, but still he saw no one.
"WHAT ARE THE DOLDRUMS?" he cried loudly, and tried very hard to see
who would answer this time.
"The Doldrums, my young friend, are where nothing ever happens and nothing
ever changes."
This time the voice came from so close that Milo jumped with surprise, for,
sitting on his right shoulder, so lightly that he hardly noticed, was a small creature
exactly the color of his shirt.
"Allow me to introduce all of us," the creature went on. "We are the
Lethargarians, at your service."
Milo looked around and, for the first time, noticed dozens of them—sitting on
the car, standing in the road, and lying all over the trees and bushes. They were very
difficult to see, because whatever they happened to be sitting on or near was exactly
the color they happened to be. Each one looked very much like the other (except for
the color, of course) and some looked even more like each other than they did like
themselves.
"I'm very pleased to meet you," said Milo, not sure whether or not he was
pleased at all. "I think I'm lost. Can you help me please?"
"Don't say 'think,' " said one sitting on his shoe, for the one on his shoulder had
fallen asleep. "It's against the law." And he yawned and fell off to sleep, too.
"No one's allowed to think in the Doldrums," continued a third, beginning to
doze off. And as each one spoke, he fell off to sleep and another picked up the
conversation with hardly any interruption.
"Don't you have a rule book? It's local ordinance 175389-J." Milo quickly
pulled the rule book from his pocket, opened to the page, and read, "Ordinance
175389-J: It shall be unlawful, illegal, and unethical to think, think of thinking,
surmise, presume, reason, meditate, or speculate while in the Doldrums. Anyone
breaking this law shall be severely punished!"
"That's a ridiculous law," said Milo, quite indignantly. "Everybody thinks."
"We don't," shouted the Lethargarians all at once. "And most of the
time you don't," said a yellow one sitting in a daffodil. "That's why you're here. You
weren't thinking, and you weren't paying attention either. People who don't pay
attention often get stuck in the Doldrums." And with that he toppled out of the
flower and fell snoring into the grass.
Milo couldn't help laughing at the little creature's strange behavior, even though
he knew it might be rude.
"Stop that at once," ordered the plaid one clinging to his stocking. "Laughing is
against the law. Don't you have a rule book? It's local ordinance 574381-W."
Opening the book again, Milo found Ordinance 574381-W: "In the Doldrums,
laughter is frowned upon and smiling is permitted only on alternate Thursdays.
Violators shall be dealt with most harshly."
"Well, if you can't laugh or think, what can you do?" asked Milo.
"Anything as long as it's nothing, and everything as long as it isn't anything,"
explained another. "There's lots to do; we have a very busy schedule—
"At 8 o'clock we get up, and then we spend:
"From 8 to 9 daydreaming.
"From 9 to 9:30 we take our early midmorning nap.
"From 9:30 to 10:30 we dawdle and delay.
"From 10:30 to 11:30 we take our late early morning nap.
"From 11:00 to 12:00 we bide our time and then eat lunch.
"From 1:00 to 2:00 we linger and loiter.
"From 2:00 to 2:30 we take our early afternoon nap.
"From 2:30 to 3:30 we put off for tomorrow what we could have done today.
"From 3:30 to 4:00 we take our early late afternoon nap.
"From 4:00 to 5:00 we loaf and lounge until dinner.
"From 6:00 to 7:00 we dillydally.
"From 7:00 to 8:00 we take our early evening nap, and then for an hour before
we go to bed at 9:00 we waste time.
"As you can see, that leaves almost no time for brooding, lagging, plodding, or
procrastinating, and if we stopped to think or laugh, we'd never get nothing done."
"You mean you'd never get anything done," corrected Milo.
"We don't want to get anything done," snapped another angrily; "we want to get
nothing done, and we can do that without your help."
"You see," continued another in a more conciliatory tone, "it's really quite
strenuous doing nothing all day, so once a week we take a holiday and go nowhere,
which was just where we were going when you came along. Would you care to join
us?"
"I might as well," thought Milo; "that's where I seem to be going anyway."
"Tell me," he yawned, for he felt ready for a nap now himself, "does everyone
here do nothing?"
"Everyone but the terrible watchdog," said two of them, shuddering in chorus.
"He's always sniffing around to see that nobody wastes time. A most unpleasant
character."
"The watchdog?" said Milo quizzically.
"THE WATCHDOG," shouted another, fainting from fright, for racing down
the road barking furiously and kicking up a great cloud of dust was the very dog of
whom they had been speaking.
"RUN!"
"WAKE UP!"
"RUN!"
"HERE HE COMES!"
"THE WATCHDOG!"
Great shouts filled the air as the Lethargarians scattered in all directions and
soon disappeared entirely.
"R-R-R-G-H-R-O-R-R-H-F-F," exclaimed the watchdog as he dashed up to the
car, loudly puffing and panting.
Milo's eyes opened wide, for there in front of him was a large dog with a
perfectly normal head, four feet, and a tail—and the body of a loudly ticking alarm
clock.
"What are you doing here?" growled the watchdog.
"Just killing time," replied Milo apologetically. "You see—"
"KILLING TIME!" roared the dog—so furiously that his alarm went off. "It's
bad enough wasting time without killing it." And he shuddered at the thought.
"Why are you in the Doldrums anyway—don't you have anywhere to go?"
"I was on my way to Dictionopolis when I got stuck here," explained Milo.
"Can you help me?"
"Help you! You must help yourself," the dog replied, carefully winding himself
with his left hind leg. "I suppose you know why you got stuck."
"I guess I just wasn't thinking," said Milo.
"PRECISELY," shouted the dog as his alarm went off again. "Now you know
what you must do."
"I'm afraid I don't," admitted Milo, feeling quite stupid.
"Well," continued the watchdog impatiently, "since you got here by not
thinking, it seems reasonable to expect that, in order to get out, you must start
thinking." And with that he hopped into the car.
"Do you mind if I get in? I love automobile rides."
Milo began to think as hard as he could (which was very difficult, since he
wasn't used to it). He thought of birds that swim and fish that fly. He thought of
yesterday's lunch and tomorrow's dinner. He thought of words that began with J and
numbers that end in 3. And, as he thought, the wheels began to turn.
"We're moving, we're moving," he shouted happily.
"Keep thinking," scolded the watchdog.
The little car started to go faster and faster as Milo's brain whirled with activity,
and down the road they went. In a few moments they were out of the Doldrums and
back on the main highway. All the colors had returned to their original brightness,
and as they raced along the road Milo continued to think of all sorts of things; of the
many detours and wrong turns that were so easy to take, of how fine it was to be
moving along, and, most of all, of how much could be accomplished with just a
little thought. And the dog, his nose in the wind, just sat back, watchfully ticking`
